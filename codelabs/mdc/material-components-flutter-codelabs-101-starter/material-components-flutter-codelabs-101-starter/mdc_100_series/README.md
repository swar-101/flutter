1. Two new text fields, each separated by a spacer are added to the `ListView` as its children.
2. The text fields each have a `decoration:` field that takes an `InputDecoration` widget.
3. The `filled:` field means the background of the text is lightly filled to help people recognize the tap or touch target area of the text field.
4. The second text field's `obscureText: true` value automatically replaces the input that user types with bullets, which is appropriate for passwords.
